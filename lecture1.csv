Question, Answer
"What is an Operating System (OS)?","The OS is a software layer between application programs and the hardware&#8203;``【oaicite:7】``&#8203;."
"What abstractions does the OS create to ease the use of hardware?","CPU to Threads, Memory to Address space, Disk to File system&#8203;``【oaicite:6】``&#8203;."
"What are the roles of the OS in terms of resource management?","Managing shared hardware resources like the Processor, Memory, Disk, Network, and potentially others, but at a cost&#8203;``【oaicite:5】``&#8203;."
"What is the 'OS and apps: perspective 2' in EECS 482?","In this perspective, the OS is the main program that calls applications as subroutines, which run until they return control back to the OS&#8203;``【oaicite:4】``&#8203;."
"Why is it important to learn about operating systems?","Learning about OS is crucial because of the universal abstractions, techniques, optimizations they offer, such as Concurrency, Caching, Indirection, Naming, Atomicity, Protection, etc. Understanding the OS helps in writing better applications&#8203;``【oaicite:3】``&#8203;."
"How has the history of operating systems evolved in relation to hardware costs?","As computing hardware was initially very expensive, OS became more sophisticated and complicated to use the hardware more efficiently&#8203;``【oaicite:2】``&#8203;."
"What is the concept of Multi-programmed batch in operating systems?","It involves overlapping CPU and I/O from different jobs for high hardware utilization, supporting concurrent execution of multiple processes while ensuring OS and process protection&#8203;``【oaicite:1】``&#8203;."
"What is the concept of Time sharing in operating systems?","Time sharing aims to allow human interaction with running programs, modeling the user as a slow I/O device, and switching between processes while waiting for user input&#8203;``【oaicite:0】``&#8203;."
"What was the operating system's role with a single operator at the console?","The OS functioned as a simple library of standard services, offering basic functionality and interactive, immediate response, but resulting in poor hardware utilization&#8203;``【oaicite:3】``&#8203;."
"What is the concept of batch processing in operating systems?","Batch processing involves minimizing user interaction by submitting a batch of jobs to wait for completion. The OS acts as a library of standard services along with a batch monitor, which leads to improved utilization by reducing idle time, although hardware may still be underutilized&#8203;``【oaicite:2】``&#8203;."
"How has the historical evolution of operating systems been influenced by the cost of hardware?","Originally, OS were simple but became complex to efficiently use expensive hardware. With the reduction in hardware costs, the necessity of these complex OS advances is questioned, particularly regarding the need for running concurrent jobs and protection in single-user systems&#8203;``【oaicite:1】``&#8203;."
"How do operating systems continue to evolve in modern times?","Modern operating systems are evolving with technologies like smartphones (Android, iOS), servers using virtual machines and hypervisors, and cloud computing platforms such as Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud&#8203;``【oaicite:0】``&#8203;."
